# Element Eraser
Element Eraser is a open-source chrome extension that removes any HTML elements that contain user specified terms. 

Simply specify the "class" attribute of the HTML elements you want to remove, add some search terms and click remove.

You can enter search terms and class attributes by typing into the corresponding input box and pressing the 'ENTER' , 'TAB' or ','(comma) keys to add them to the list.

It is also possibly to store and retrieve settings using a 'key'.

Element Eraser can also run continuously if the toggle switch is flipped to ON.
